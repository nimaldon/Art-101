			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use loops to print fizz buzz boom depending a numbers multipliers.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems I had were with the loops itself and just forgetting important code. Debugging helped me see 
						how messy my output was so I fixed that in my js.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall I completed this lab quickly and I was able to fix all of my problems. One of the more challenging ones for me so far.</p>
