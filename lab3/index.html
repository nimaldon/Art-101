			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to succedfully build file structures and link photos.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems with having some photos pop up, but quickly figured out the issue with my path.
						 Other issues icluded issues with my repository that put me a bit behind. Thankfully some coding friends helped fix that for me. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went well, and I felt a bit more confident coding. Althought I had some problems along the way,
						 in the end ultimately it was succesful and my page worked great.</p>
